(* ^ Would it be possible to define all 4 strings on a single line? I could have put all of it (the 4 strings) in 1 line, but it would look bad and would be harder to read. *)
(* Like this:
string1() string2() string3() string4();
or like this:
string1(), string2(), string3(), string4();
or another way?
